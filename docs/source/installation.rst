Installation guide
==================

.. prerequisites::

   *  A computer running Windows 10 or 11,
   *  A working installation of `git for windows <https://gitforwindows.org>`_, and
   *  `Notepad++ <https://notepad-plus-plus.org>`_ or some other decent text editor.

.. tip::

   iblrigv8 can be installed alongside older versions of iblrig without affecting the latter.

Prepare Windows PowerShell
--------------------------

Open Windows PowerShell in administrator mode:

* Click on the Windows Start button or press the Windows key on your keyboard.
* Type "PowerShell" into the search bar.
* You should see "Windows PowerShell" or "PowerShell" in the search results.
* Right-click on it.
* In the context menu that appears, select "Run as administrator."

Now, run the following command at the prompt of Windows PowerShell:

.. code-block:: powershell

   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

.. warning:: Make sure you exit the Administrator PowerShell before continuing with the next steps!

   In PowerShell, there are execution policies that determine the level of security for running scripts. The default execution
   policy is often set to ``Restricted``, which means that scripts are not allowed to run. However, to install Python or run
   certain scripts, you need to adjust the execution policy. By setting the execution policy to ``RemoteSigned``, you are
   allowing the execution of locally created scripts without any digital signature while requiring that remotely downloaded
   scripts (from the internet) must be digitally signed by a trusted source to run. This strikes a balance between security
   and usability.


Install Python 3.10
-------------------

Open a `new` Windows Powershell prompt (no administrator mode) and run the following:

.. code-block:: powershell

   New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path C:\Temp
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.11/python-3.10.11-amd64.exe -OutFile C:\Temp\python-3.10.11-amd64.exe
   Start-Process -NoNewWindow -Wait -FilePath C:\Temp\python-3.10.11-amd64.exe -ArgumentList "/passive", "InstallAllUsers=0", "Include_launcher=0", "Include_test=0"

Check that everything worked by running the following command:

.. code-block:: powershell

   C:\Users\IBLuser\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\.\python.exe --version

The command should return ``Python 3.10.11``

   These commands will create a temporary directory, download the Python installer from a specific URL, and then execute the
   installer with specific installation options, all in a controlled and automated manner.


Install iblrigv8
----------------

1. From the Powershell command line, clone the `iblrigv8` branch of iblrig to ``C:\iblrigv8``:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      git clone -b iblrigv8 https://github.com/int-brain-lab/iblrig.git C:\iblrigv8


2. Install a new virtual environment and update pip (modify the <Username> value if needed)

   .. code-block:: powershell

      C:\Users\IBLuser\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\.\python.exe -m venv C:\iblrigv8\venv
      C:\iblrigv8\venv\scripts\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel


3. Install iblrig in editable mode

   .. code-block:: powershell

      C:\iblrigv8\venv\scripts\Activate.ps1
      cd C:\iblrigv8
      pip install -e .


4. Install additional tasks and extractors for personal projects (optional)

   .. code-block:: powershell

      cd C:\
      git clone https://github.com/int-brain-lab/project_extraction.git
      cd project_extraction
      pip install -e .


5. Install Bonsai in portable mode

   .. code-block:: powershell

      cd C:\iblrigv8\Bonsai
      powershell.exe .\install.ps1
      cd ..


Update iblrigv8
---------------

   .. code-block:: powershell

      C:\iblrigv8\venv\scripts\Activate.ps1
      cd C:\iblrigv8
      upgrade_iblrig

   alternatively, run:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      C:\iblrigv8\venv\scripts\Activate.ps1
      cd C:\iblrigv8
      git pull
      pip install --upgrade -e .


Configuration instructions
--------------------------


Rig configuration files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copy template settings files.

.. code-block::

   cd C:\iblrigv8\settings
   cp hardware_settings_template.yaml hardware_settings.yaml
   cp iblrig_settings_template.yaml iblrig_settings.yaml
   explorer C:\iblrigv8\settings


Update the 2 settings files, these values can likely be found in the `C:\iblrig_params\.iblrig_params.json` file if working with a existing rig

*  iblrig_settings.yaml
*  hardware_settings.yaml


Setup ONE
~~~~~~~~~


Setup ONE to connect to https://alyx.internationalbrainlab.org, you will need your Alyx username and password.

See instructions for that here: https://int-brain-lab.github.io/iblenv/notebooks_external/one_quickstart.html


.. exercise:: Make sure you can connect to Alyx !

   Open a Python shell in the environment and connect to Alyx (you may have to setup ONE)

   .. code-block::

      C:\iblrigv8\venv\scripts\Activate.ps1
      ipython

   Then at the Ipython prompt

   .. code-block:: python

      from one.api import ONE
      one = ONE(username='your_username', password='your_password', base_url='https://alyx.internationalbrainlab.org')


.. exercise:: You can check that everything went fine by running the test suite:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      cd C:\iblrigv8
      python -m unittest discover

   The tests should pass to completion after around 40 seconds
