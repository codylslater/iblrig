    Attributes
    ----------
    fn : Callable
        The function to be executed concurrently.

    args : tuple
        Positional arguments for the function.

    kwargs : dict
        Keyword arguments for the function.

    signals : WorkerSignals
        An instance of WorkerSignals used to emit signals.

    Methods
    -------
    run() -> None
        The main entry point for running the worker. Executes the provided function and
        emits signals accordingly.
